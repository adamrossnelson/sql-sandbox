**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**: This system manages data organized in rows and columns across related tables. It uses a structured approach to store and retrieve information efficiently.

**SQL Query**: An SQL query is a specific statement used to interact with a database, allowing you to retrieve, modify, or create data. It's the language you use to "talk" to your database.

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**: CRUD represents the four fundamental operations you can perform on database records: adding new data, fetching existing data, changing it, or removing it. These are the basic actions for managing information.

**SELECT**: The SELECT command is a core SQL instruction used to fetch data from a database table. You can retrieve all columns with * or specify just the ones you need.

**FILTER (WHERE clause)**: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows, ensuring only those that meet specific conditions are included in your results. It helps you pinpoint exactly what data you're looking for.

**JOIN (Inner & Outer)**: JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns. An Inner Join returns only matching rows, while an Outer Join includes unmatched rows from one or both tables, filling in NULLs where there's no match.

**Primary Key**: A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record (row) in a table. It cannot be NULL and ensures every entry is distinct.

**Field (Column/Variable)**: A Field is a vertical category of data in a table, defining the type of information stored in each record. Think of it as a column heading like "Name" or "Age."

**Record (Row)**: A Record is a single, horizontal entry in a table, representing one complete instance of data. It contains all the information for a single item or entity.

**Data Type**: A Data Type defines the format of data allowed in a field, such as Integer, Text, or Date. It ensures data consistency and proper storage.

**Normalization**: Normalization is the process of structuring a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It helps save space and prevents inconsistencies.

**Sqlite3**: Sqlite3 is a command-line tool used to open and interact with a SQLite database. It lets you run SQL commands directly on a SQLite file.
